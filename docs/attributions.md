# Attributions

This project wouldn’t be as complete without the incredible work of others. **Special thanks** to the following sources:

-   **`_can_do_colour()`:** Logic for checking environment variables to determine if a terminal supports color was adapted from [`termcolor`](https://github.com/termcolor/termcolor). See [THIRD PARTY LICENSES](license.md#third-party-licenses) for full license details.

-   **8-bit Color Naming:** X-Term color names used for 8-bit colors were referenced and adapted from the excellent [**256-colors-cheatsheet**](https://www.ditig.com/publications/256-colors-cheat-sheet). _(Cleaned up and modernized for Ansy)_

-   The `colors` module uses a rich collection of **1400+** colors, sourced from the [Corpora project](https://github.com/dariusk/corpora) by Darius Kazemi.

**Huge thanks to all of you** for saving me hours of reinventing the wheel, and **for making Ansy better** than it could’ve been alone.

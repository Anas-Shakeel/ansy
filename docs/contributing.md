## **How to Contribute**

git clone https://github.com/anas-shakeel/ansy.git
cd ansy
```

### Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Install Dev Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

### Create a New Branch

Create a new branch for your changes:

```bash
# Checkout a new branch and make your changes
git checkout -b my-new-feature-branch
# Make your changes...
```

### Run Tests

Format the code using `black` and Run tests locally to make sure everything is working as expected.

```bash
black . # Format code
pytest . # Test code
```

Make sure all tests pass before opening a pull request.

### Documentation Updates

If you're updating **function signatures**, **APIs**, **examples**, or **docstrings** that appear in the documentation, please make sure to update the relevant parts of the `docs/` too.

**Ansy** uses `mkdocs` with the **Material for MkDocs** theme to power its documentation.

To preview the docs locally:

```bash
mkdocs serve
# Visit http://localhost:8000
```

**How docs are deployed?**

Documentation is deployed by **Maintainers** using `mkdocs gh-deploy`, But only after pull requests are **reviewed** and **merged**. Contributors **should not** run `mkdocs gh-deploy` themselves.

### Commit Changes and Submit a Pull Request

1. Commit your changes:

    ```bash
    git commit -m "Add a new feature"
    ```

2. Push to your fork:

    ```bash
    git push origin my-new-feature-branch
    ```

3. Open a pull request on GitHub üôå
